    <h2>My experience</h2>

    <section>
        My experience with coding so far has come from the year and half of programming classes that I took while majoring in computer science at ACC. I was orginally supposed to tranfer to UT after I finish ACC, however I changed my mind and decided I need to take the quickest route towards getting a job in the text field. After I get a good job, I will then go back and finish up school.</section>
